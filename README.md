### 👨‍💻 about me  

hey! i'm a software engineering student at **AASTU**. i spend most of my time building things and trying to figure out how to make software that actually matters. 

lately, i’ve been really focused on **mobile development**—it’s my main thing. but i also work on the **backend** side to keep everything running properly. i'm also pretty big on **ui/ux** because i think how an app feels is just as important as how it works.

- 🎓 student at aastu — somehow managed a **3.93 gpa** so far, just trying to keep learning.
- 📱 **mobile dev is the core** — i'm all in on **Flutter** right now.
- ⚙️ i also handle **backend & web** (next.js, node, express) to build full systems.
- 🎨 **ui/ux** — i care a lot about clean designs and making things easy for people to use.
