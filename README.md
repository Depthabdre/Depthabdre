### 👨‍💻 about me  

hey! i'm a software engineering student at **AASTU**. i spend most of my time building things and trying to figure out how to make software that actually matters and helps people. 

lately, i’ve been really focused on **mobile development**—it’s my main thing. but i also work on the **backend** side to keep everything running properly. for me, it's not about making things look fancy, it's about making sure they actually work and solve real problems.

when i'm not building apps, i'm usually on **leetcode** or **codeforces** trying to sharpen my problem-solving skills and learn how to write more efficient code.

- 🎓 student at aastu — somehow managed a **3.93 gpa** so far, just trying to keep learning.
- 📱 **mobile dev is the core** — i'm all in on **Flutter** right now.
- ⚙️ **backend & web** — i use **Node**, **Express**, and **PostgreSQL** to build solid, useful systems.
- 🧠 **problem solving** — constantly practicing on leetcode and codeforces to stay sharp.
- 🛠️ **impact** — i just want to build software that is actually beneficial for users.
